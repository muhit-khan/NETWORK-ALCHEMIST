# Network Alchemist

## Overview
Network Alchemist is a desktop application designed to streamline network troubleshooting. It allows users to input Windows Command Line Interface (CLI) commands and displays the output in a Graphical User Interface (GUI). This makes the process of network troubleshooting more accessible to those who are not comfortable with the CLI, and more efficient for those who are.

## Features
The application supports the following commands:
- ipconfig /all
- ping "URL"
- traceroute
- nsslookup
- ipconfig /flushdns
- netsh winsock reset
- ipconfig /release
- netsh int ip reset
- netsh winsock reset

## Usage
1. **Command Input**: The application provides an input field for users to enter the desired CLI command.
2. **Command Processing**: The application processes the entered command in the background without freezing the GUI.
3. **Output Display**: The application displays the output of the command in a readable format in the GUI.
4. **Error Handling**: The application handles errors gracefully, providing informative error messages to the user.

## Installation
Detailed installation instructions will be provided soon.

## Future Scope
Future enhancements could include the ability to save command outputs for future reference, and the integration of more advanced network troubleshooting tools.
